In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 

This is an assignment to investigate how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Objective: assess if there are similarities or differences between annual members and casual riders on utilization of bikes based on days of week, months of last 12 years, ride routes, bike types, ride length.
